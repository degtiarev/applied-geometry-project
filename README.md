# Applied Geometry Project
The purpose of this project is to study different aspects of applied geometry and implement several
curves and surfaces. During the work we implemented:
* our own version of a 2nd degree B-spline curve
* curve resulting from blending two curves with a B function over a given part of the two curves
* curve to use as model for the simulation
* our own version of a GERBS curve of blending spline type
* dynamic visual special effect using affine transformations of local curves
* our version of a GERBS surface of blending spline type
